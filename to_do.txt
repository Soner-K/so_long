enemy moves : make them simple

once moves are done, for parsing the map, only need to check around the first
position of the player. Since the enemies move, coins should be accessible?

//enemy moves even if key not valid

issue to solve : enemy_movment only seems to work with one enemy. The other still moves, but only in the
mapp array, and not in the screen. Explained (?) by the fact that in enemies' array, only
the first cell counts, the other(s) take its value, dont know why.

Collisions between enemies fucks up everything too

AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
